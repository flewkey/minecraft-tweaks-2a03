2a03-minecraft-tweaks

This repository contains simple modifications for the 2a03.party Minecraft
server. I have replaced the patches with a Fabric mod.
If you want a new feature added, you can either make an issue here or e-mail
me. Preferably the latter, because I am inactive on GitHub.
You probably want to ignore this.
